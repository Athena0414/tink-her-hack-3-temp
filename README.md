### Project Description
Our project is an intelligent platform designed to connect individuals with specialized mental health professionals tailored to their specific needs. By analyzing user input regarding their mental health concerns, challenges, or preferences, the platform recommends qualified experts such as addiction psychologists, marriage counselors, trauma specialists, or anxiety therapists.

### The Problem statement
Finding the right mental health professional for specific needs, like addiction or relationship issues, is often confusing and time-consuming. Many people lack guidance, leading to delays or mismatched care. A solution is needed to simplify and personalize this process.

### The Solution
Connecting the right mental professional with people who deserves the right treatment at right time.
